====== TITLE: Dustin Sitar ======


Dustin Sitar was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. In 1999 he left to experience the state of Texas and study at Texas Christian University. He graduated in 2004 with an E-business degree.

He promptly decided that the exploding poker industry was where he would make his living for the next 14 years. Independent, driven, and self-motivated; poker was an excellent fit until declining player pools and a desire for intellectual expansion drove Dustin to look for a different field to move into.

Encountering John Bunch, Dustin began to see the potential and intelligent beauty of the exploding field of self-management. Currently pursuing his MBA, Dustin looks forward to being part of a community of like-minded individuals hoping to change the business landscape.
