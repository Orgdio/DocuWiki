====== Governance and Roles ======
==== Governance ====

We endeavor to make orgdio a collaborative, enjoyable, SM (self-management) development project. We will promote all things helpful to this area, helping beginners and experts alike.

We believe in providing an open, amicable environment for people to contribute pursuant to our Code of Conduct Policy.

Our governance encourages a bottom-up approach. All responsibilities and all abilities are available to all community members unless restricted by a current role.

The plan for orgdio is to embrace knowledge and understanding of all forms of SM. The goal is to explore and improve SM in any way possible.

The governance structure of orgdio will follow these guidelines:

  * provide a space where any contribution is available to anyone unless otherwise restricted
  * provide modules for restricting authority to a specific role (ie Speed Governance Module)
  * allow changes to the governance of the community as long as it supports the core values
  * ensure transparency of orgdio decisions

Any community member may call for governance to be processed at any time. Role assignments/assignments are done by a process of majority vote. (For clarity, it is probable that majority vote for role assignments is the best or most scalable way to conduct this activity but works current at current capacity)
