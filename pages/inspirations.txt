If you want to dig deep into the world that Orgdio envisions and how it plans to get there, you are in the right place!

==== The Challenges ====
In this section, you will find links to content that informs the challenge we are trying to solve: the end state for most companies, no matter how stable they might seem, is death.

==== The Solution Ideas ====

There are many great works that shine a light on how we might structure our companies to avoid or solve for the challenges listed above. Just as a tip for the videos below, you can generally skip about halfway through them because they are all essentially starting with trying to convince you of the same problem/challenge, which has been outlined above.

  * Frederick Laloux's Reinventing Organizations. This work posits that there have been different paradigms in which human organizations have operated in over the history of humanity. These paradigms range from a "red organization" which operates like a wolf-pack with a single alpha-wolf to an "orange organization" which operates in a very traditional top-down hierarchy. Frederick states that a new paradigm for organizations is emerging currently, which he dubs a "teal organization". Teal organizations are run on the concepts of self-organization, wholeness, and evolutionary purpose. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk|Video]].

  * Complexity Labs has an extensive suite of courses and articles on span from Systems Thinking to Complex Adaptive Systems. [[http://complexitylabs.io/|site]]. Specifically, their video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOTWIPmkdzo|resilience]] provides a good mental framework to bring to bear on organizations.

The works above offer broad-base concepts for organizations to think about. The works below are more specific low-level methodologies that have been implemented at organizations to try to help organizations match the patterns described in the works above.
